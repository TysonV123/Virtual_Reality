    <h2 style="color:orangered;text-align:center;font-size:200%;">Brief details</h2>
    <p style="color:red;text-align:center;">Virtual reality (VR) is a simulated experience that employs pose tracking and 3D near-eye displays to give the user an immersive feel of a virtual world. Applications of virtual reality include entertainment (particularly video games) , education (such as medical or military training) and business (such as virtual meetings). Other distinct types of VR-style technology include augmented reality and mixed reality,
    sometimes referred to as extended reality or XR, although definitions are currently changing due to the nascence of the industry.</p>

    <h2 style="color:red;text-align:center;"> Current Usage</h2>
    <p style="color:palevioletred;text-align:center;">Currently, standard virtual reality systems use either virtual reality headsets or multi-projected environments to generate some realistic images, sounds and other sensations that simulate a user's physical presence in a virtual environment. A person using virtual reality equipment is able to look around the artificial world, move around in it, and interact with virtual features or items. The effect is commonly created by VR headsets consisting of a head-mounted display with a small screen in front of the eyes, but can also be created through specially designed rooms with multiple large screens. Virtual reality typically incorporates auditory and video feedback, but may also allow other types of sensory and force feedback through haptic technology.</p>
